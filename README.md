# *Lifetime of Memes*
This project was motivated by the thought that memes do not stay as popular for as long as they used to before, or in other words, that memes are dying faster than they used to. I attempted with this project to get a more concrete answer as to the nature of the lifetime of memes. To do so, I looked to first create a database of memes, find when they were most popular, and finally find out how long they lasted in the spotlight. Therefore, this project was broken up into three sections. Web-scraping the meme names from knowyourmemes.com, using google trend's unofficial api (pytrends) to find when each meme was most popular, and to again use pytrends to find how long they lasted.
