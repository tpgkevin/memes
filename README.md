# **Lifetime of Memes**
This project was motivated by the commonly held belief that memes used to stay more popular than they currently do, or in other words, that memes are dying faster than they used to. I created this project to get a more concrete answer as to the nature of the lifetime of memes. To do so, I created a database of meme names by web-scraping them from knowyourmemes.com website, acquired their daily popularity using google trend's unofficial api (pytrends), and finally computed how long they lasted in the spotlight using their half-life as measure of their lifetime.
## Web-scraping for Memes Names
The first step in this project involved using the beautifulsoup library to webscrape knowyourmemes.com to collect the names of all the memes and place them in a single list. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/tpgkevin/memes/blob/main/Memes_Data_Collection_and_Cleaning.ipynb) in the "Scraping for Meme Names" section. Most of this portion revolves around automating the scraping of the website's html code to parse out all meme names. This step required finding a way to deal with an infitenly scrolling page as well as a deeply nested html code.
