# **Lifetime of Memes**
This project was motivated by the commonly held belief that memes used to stay more popular than they currently do, or in other words, that memes are dying faster. I created this project to get a more concrete answer as to the nature of the lifetime of memes. To do so, I created a database of meme names by web-scraping them from knowyourmemes.com website, acquired their daily popularity using google trend's unofficial api (pytrends), and finally determined how long they lasted in the spotlight by computing their half-life. The code for this project is broken up into two jupyter notebooks: [Data collection and Cleaning](https://github.com/tpgkevin/memes/blob/main/Memes_Data_Collection_and_Cleaning.ipynb) and [Data Analysis and visualization](https://github.com/tpgkevin/memes/blob/main/Memes_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
## Web-scraping for Memes Names
The first step in this project involved using the beautifulsoup library to webscrape knowyourmemes.com to collect the names of all the memes and compile them in a single database. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/tpgkevin/memes/blob/main/Memes_Data_Collection_and_Cleaning.ipynb) in the "Scraping for Meme Names" section. Most of this portion revolves around automating the scraping of the website's html code to parse out all meme names. This step required finding a way to deal with an infitenly scrolling page as well as a deeply nested html code.
## Meme Popularity
The next step was to find when every meme was most popular as well calculating how long they remained popular for. This was a two step proccess. First, I used the pytrends library with a wide scope (data from all time) to find what year and month they were most popular. I then reran the memes through pytrends again with a narrower scope (1 month before and 7 months after the peak date) to get an accurate daily estimation of each memes popularity. The code for this section can be found [here](https://github.com/tpgkevin/memes/blob/main/Memes_Data_Collection_and_Cleaning.ipynb) in "Finding lifetime of a meme" section. A single main method is not written as each section needs to be run multiple times across multiple days due to google trend's rate limit.
## Analysis and visualization
The goal of this project was to find whether meme are dying faster than they used to. If this were to be the case, we would expect to see a neagative correlation across time for their lifetime. However, this was not the case. The Pearson Coeffcient value was 0.0011 with a p-value of 0.9866. While there was no long-term trends across time, there are statistically significant differences between some years and it would be interesting to look deeper into what caused said disparity. Here is the average lifetime of memes across years:
